Context Dump: Architecture Shift from Render to Hetzner
Your current architecture (pre-shift) was likely hosted on Render (from render.yaml – a platform for easy web app deploys like Vercel/Heroku). The shift to Hetzner VPS (self-managed server with Docker) is a strategic move for more control, cost savings, and customization (e.g., LangChain integration). Here's a full context dump:
Before: Render Architecture

How it Worked: Render auto-builds/deploys from GitHub (frontend as static site with index.html, backend as Node service). Env vars in dashboard. Simple, serverless-like.
Pros (Why You Used It): Easy setup, auto-scaling, free tier, built-in CI/CD. Good for prototyping (e.g., early commits with mocks).
Cons (Why Shift): Limited control (no custom Docker, VPS-level access), higher costs for scale (~$25/month for basic), no easy local AI hosting (LangChain/Ollama needs persistent server).

After: Hetzner VPS Architecture

How it Will Work: VPS (e.g., CX21: 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, €4.79/month) running Docker Compose (backend + frontend services). Nginx serves frontend, proxies to backend. Supabase for DB (external). Cloudflare Tunnel for secure exposure if needed.
Pros: Full control (custom Docker, SSH access), cheap (scale to GPU for Ollama), persistent (run 24/7), private (host LangChain locally). Better for production (custom monitoring, logs).
Cons: More setup (SSH, firewalls), manual deploys (git pull + docker up), maintenance (updates).

Key Differences & Benefits of the Shift

Hosting Model: Render (serverless, auto) → Hetzner (VPS, manual) – more power for AI/custom.
Cost: Render (~$20–50/month for scale) → Hetzner (€5–20/month) – 70% savings.
Control: Render (limited) → Hetzner (full SSH/Docker) – enables LangChain/Ollama integration.
Performance: Render (global CDN) → Hetzner (EU servers, ~50ms to Mumbai) – add Cloudflare CDN for edge.
Security: Similar (both HTTPS), but Hetzner allows finer firewalls.

Step-by-Step Shift Plan

Prep (1 hour): Backup Render data/DB. Export env vars.
Setup Hetzner (30 min): Create VPS (Ubuntu 22.04), SSH key, install Docker/Compose.
Clone & Configure (30 min):git clone repo, copy .env.production, adjust for VPS (e.g., ports).
Build & Run (15 min):docker compose up -d – test locally first.
Secure & Domain (1 hour): UFW firewall (allow 80/22/3001), point domain A record to VPS IP, Certbot for SSL.
Migrate Data (30 min): Dump/restore Supabase if needed (but hosted Supabase stays external).
Monitor & Scale: Add UptimeRobot, logs to Supabase or external.

This shift makes your app more self-contained and AI-ready. Proceed – it's a great move! 🚀
